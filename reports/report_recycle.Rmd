Deciding to change 3 and 7 to the mid point between the one before and the one after
```{r}
yr4_index <- 158:209
yr123_index <- 1:157
ts2_adjusted <- ts2
ts2_adjusted[3] = mean(c(ts2[2], ts2[3]))
ts2_adjusted[7] = mean(c(ts2[6], ts2[8]))
plot(diff(ts2_adjusted, 52), type = "l")
plot(diff(diff(ts2_adjusted, 52)), type = "l")
mod_mse(ts2_adjusted[yr123_index], ts2_adjusted[yr4_index], c(0, 1, 1), c(0, 1, 1))
```
Unfortunately, I tried to remove the anomality but failed. Additionally, I use the general seasonal model with the adjusted data but the results get worse by a good margin.
